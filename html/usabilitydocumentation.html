	<h4 style="display:inline;">Summary of Findings</h4>
	<p>The main take away after running the first usability test was that my site wasn't easy to navigate because of the lack of consistency from page to page. Another issue was that when not on the "My Garden" page, the user tried clicking on the items in their garden in hopes to get more information about them. After following up with the user, she said she didn't know what page she was on as she didn't notice the header change. She also said that she wishes the search box was directly able to be written into without having to first click on the "Search" button. Lastly, she said that it was hard for her to read the white text on the garden image background.<br>To fix the issue of consistency, I created a standard layout for the home page and fitted the other pages to that layout. This created a very consistent feel that the user was comfortable with as seen in the second usability test. To satisfy the user's wishful clicking on the items in her garden I made them buttons that are now able to be clicked on. Upon clicking on them the user is taken to the info page for that item. In conjuction with the standardizing the home page, I made the header stay the same and just indicated which page the user was on my having the menu bar item look pushed down. After following up with the second usability test, the user said she had a much easier time navigating the website and accomplishing her task due to the consistency of the layout and colour schemes.</p>
