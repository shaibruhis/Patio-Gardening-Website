	<h4 style="display:inline;">Font Scheme</h4>
	<p>I decided to use lowercase letters in my buttons (rather than all uppercase) because it makes them easier to read and to avoid the standard that text in all uppercase letters feels like the page is shouting it out at the user. For the title and menu bar in the header I chose to use a cursive font. Even though it is slightly harder to read, cursive fonts are widely known as title/header fonts and also draws the user attention to it. Also, I made the "My Garden" button have the cursive font as well. I did this because this button is actually a "menu" button but isn't in the menu bar in the header (I discuss why I did this in in the Lines/Borders Scheme). Due to the Gestalt similarity principle, giving it the same font as the menu bar lets the user know that it is connected to the menu bar in terms of functionality. Other than that I chose to use Trebuchet MS as it is a pretty neutral font making it easier for the user to read. The only bolded font on my website is in the "My Garden" container when there are no items in it. This is to draw the users attention to this area and give them guidance on how they can interact with the site.</p><br>
	<h4 style="display:inline;">Colour Scheme</h4>
	<p>I chose to use a "monochromatic plus white" colour scheme for the buttons because the varying values create a dynamic feel and provide a hierarchy of importance therefore bringing the users eyes to the critical parts of the website - the elements with highest contrast. I chose the colour green because it is a commonly accepted color for earth and nature which are both big parts of gardening. Also, the specific color green I chose (Hue = 122 degrees) falls just to the left of the center of the colour spectrum which means it has a short wavelength causing it to be more comfrortable to look at. To further give the site a comfortable feel (which is the exact goal of this site - to make people feel more comrtable with their patio/balcony garden by providing them with info about it), the different colours used, with the exception of the border, have a low to mid-range saturation value. This provides a calming sensation as the colors aren't too bright or harsh on your eyes but rather just "pop out" enough off the white background to be distinguished. This is especially true for the very low contrast background color of the intro div. The green border has a very high saturation value making it bright therefore giving it a sense of importance. I did this because these buttons are the part of the site the user interacts with to navigate and accomplish tasks. The image used for the background of "My Garden" contains quite complementary colours (green and reddish-brown). This too is used to produce a dynamic aspect that lets the user know it can be interacted with. It also is the first thing the user looks at when entering the site. Once the user's eyes land on this image they then go on to read the text inside the image which gives them the main instructions of how to interact with the site. The reason I chose the color I did for the text is to contrast it against the green leaves in the image. I chose black for the font color of text that is just informational and white for the font color of text that can be clicked on which creates consistentcy and enhances the user's mental model and lessens the articulatory distance. This is the same reason I made all clickable things on the sight the same style following the Gestalt Similarity Principle. To follow a common standard, I made the button background change to a duller shade of green to notify the user they are hovering over it. Similarly I flipped the border color and the background color of the button when the user clicks the button to give the physical appearance the button is being pushed down. I have attached the designeye below. NOTE: As discussed on Piazza, the designeye sight does not except hex input so the colors actually used on my website are not exactly the same as the ones presented in the designeye. Also, there are elements on my site that didn't appear on the designeye. The background color of my buttons when they are not being hovered over aren't represented in designeye. And the text color inside "My Garden" box doesn't have a corresponding element on designeye.

	<h4 style="display:inline;">Lines/Borders Scheme</h4>
	<p>To start off, I wanted to make it friendly to a wide range of window sizes so I made the outermost margins adjust automatically to keep the content centered in the window. I made the header two lines for two reasons. First I wanted to line the menu bar up over the content box. And second I wanted to have some distance between the menu and the item search bar. The reason I wanted the menu to line up over the content box is because based on Gestalt's Common Fate principle, this gives the user some indication that they are connected. When navigating through the site, the user will realize that the content window is the main thing that changes. When deciding what to do with the item search bar I was considering a couple of things. The biggest decision was how tall to make it. I wanted it to fit in the header with the menu bar but when I made it the same height as the menu buttons, it looked weird. When you would start typing into it there would be a lot of white space on the top and bottom of the text. I tried fixing this by making the font bigger to fill the search box heightwise but then the text was bigger than almost all the other text on the screen. So, what I ended up doing was letting the height default to the height for that praticular font size to prevent it from having all the whitespace. To make it fit in the menu bar I alligned the bottom of the search bar with the bottom of the menu. I did this because alignment creates a sense of grouping (again, Gestalt's Common Fate principle). Moving down the page the next div is the intro paragraph. I decided to make this align horizontally with the other items in the window to reduce the total number of vertical lines on the site. Under this div is the main part of the website. That is why I have it take up the most amount of room on the page. I still aligned it horizontally with everything else though because it is related to them and also to reduce the number of vertical lines. I strived for the least amount of vertical lines because the less there are the less cluttered the page feels. With few vertical lines there is a feeling of simplicity and calmness. I want the user to have these feelings about patio/balcony gardening because they invoke comfort. The screen complexity is directly calculated from the vertical and horizontal alignment points so I made as few of these as possible. Also, the fact that the lines are vertical and horizontal with 90 degree angles makes the site feel calmer. The reason the main content window is bigger than the "My Garden" window is because it is more important. Like I said above, this is the thing that changes from page to page. I decided to the put the "My Garden" button above the garden to serve as the header for the garden area. Also, the reason I put the button here is because the garden area is quite small on the page and it gives the user a very quick way (without having to move their eyes or the mouse all the way up to the menu bar) of accessing the "My Garden" page. This will be especially useful once the user is done dragging items to their garden as their mouse will be right there in the garden box. The height of the "My Garden" button is the same height as the menu bar buttons which lets the user know that it is connected to the menu bar - it allows the user to navigate to the "My Garden" page. On the "My Garden" page the garden, which was on the right side of the window on all the other pages, is now on the left side as the main content box. I decided to break the consistency of having it on the right side and move it to the left because the main focus of this page is the garden. I decided the consistency of keeping the layout of the page the same (in terms of div sizes) with the main focus always being on the left in the big content box was more important than keeping the consistency of having the garden on the right because again I wanted it to be simple for the user to look at and follow their mental model of the site. The less amount of changing things (in terms of the layout) from page to page the better as each time the user visits a page their mental model is reinforced in terms of where the everything is, including the main content window. The only discrepency in the layout is on the Cherry Tomato page. On this page, the main content window is longer, extending downward past the vertical alignment it has on the other pages. The reason for this is that this page is supposed to show detailed information of the item. The main content window isn't that big originally and because I want as much info on the screen as possible I made it bigger. I decided to extend it downward (as opposed to upwards or sideways) because this doesnt mess up the layout of anything else on the page. I chose to use thin black borders for the elements of the site that aren't immediately clickable. For the clickable parts I used a thicker green border. The thicker border makes it stand out more to the user. The reason I didn't use a border for the intro paragraph is because I feel that this is the least important part of the website. I want the user to be able to find the important parts of the website as fast as possible. Also I specifically chose the background of the intro region to have as much white in it as possible (value = 100%) making it have very little contrast and almost blending into the background of the site making it less important and less noticble to the user. For the border corners, I chose a consisent 5px radius for each item which helps to unify the design. The reason I chose the image for the background of the "My Garden" section is discussed in the Colour Scheme paragraph above.</p><br>
	<h4 style="display:inline;">Assumptions</h4>
	<p>This site uses sessionStorage and was programmed for Chrome. A lot of the functionality doesn't work in IE or Firefox and the design layout is completely messed up :(. Open in Chrome to see full functionality and layout (as seen in the usability video). Also this site was programmed on a Mac with OSX 10.9 which hides scrollbars except when they are in use. When they are in use they go over the content and don't take up any space. When testing on PC, the scroll bar does take up space and this is why the vertical lines of the main content box do not always align from page to page. So, for best results open in a Chrome browser on a Mac :). I have attached screen shots of the site running on my local machine. Lastly, if the download link for the video gives you issues, click the "Play as is" button.<img src="../extras/homeMac.png"><img src="../extras/veggiesMac.png"><img src="../extras/tomatoMac.png"><img src="../extras/gardenMac.png">Because I was limited on time, I decided to implement 4 pages that show the basic functions of the site. As seen on the site and in the usability test video, the most interesting thing I implemented was the drag and drop feature allowing users to drag desired items into their virtual garden. Also, I implemented an item search box but it is currently hard coded to go to the Cherry Tomato page for every search. If time wasn't a constraint I would have been able to include more functionality to the site including a streaming "Veggie of the Week" window, a fully functioning item search box, and the ability to add your own comments/reviews to items.  The streaming window on the home page would ideally have 3 screens that would rotate through every 5 seconds showing a "Fruit of the Week" and a "Herb of the Week" in addition to the "Herb of the Weel". Also, only "Veggies" has content and working links and on the "Veggies" page the Cherry Tomatos are the only item to have content and working links. The repeated item is to show the scrolling functionality. The other veggies, fruits, and herbs would act exactly like the Cherry Tomatos with info for their specific item. The item images currently have a white background. Ideally for the images of all these items I would use images with transparent background but because I got these off the web, I wasn't able to find ones with transparent background. Another important feature that I left out is the ability to adjust your garden size, limiting the capacity of items allowed in "My Garden". The user would be able to go to the "My Garden" page and adjust how much available area they have on their specific patio/balcony. Then when they dragged items into their virtual garden, space would be allocated for the item plus the items required to grow it (pots, wirecages, etc.) and the total available space of their garden would decrease. As the garden got closer to capacity the items on each of the 3 plant pages ("Veggies", "Fruits", and "Herbs") that required more space than the available space would become greyed-out and unallowed to be dragged into their garden. In addition to this feature, once a user dragged a few items into their garden, other items would be suggested that complement the current items in their garden. The complementing could be based on compatability of sharing watering systems, plants that go well together in meals, plants that take up very little space together, etc. Another added feature would be the ability to remove items from your garden one at a time by dragging them out of the garden or by hitting a small button inside each item in the shape of a circle with an 'x' through it (like the tabs on a browser). Lastly, the text inside the div just under the header would change on each page to a relevant intro to the specific page.</p>
